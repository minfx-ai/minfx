# Backend Common

This module provides common data models and utilities for backend communication.

## Purpose

The backends module defines shared data structures and utilities used across different backend implementations for communicating with Neptune services.

## Key Components

- `api_model.py`: Common API data models (e.g., MultipartConfig for file uploads)
- `utils.py`: Shared utility functions for backend operations

## Functionality

This module provides:
- Configuration models for API operations
- Shared data structures for backend communication
- Common utilities for backend implementations

## Usage

This module is used internally by backend implementations to share common data models and utilities, ensuring consistency across different backend types.

## Parent Module

See `../README.md` for information about the common utilities system.
