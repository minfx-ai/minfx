# Set Value Types

This module provides value type classes for set attributes.

## Purpose

The set value types module defines the data classes representing different types of set values that can be stored in Neptune.

## Key Components

- `Set`: Base class for all set value types
- `StringSet`: String set value type

## Functionality

These value types:
- Represent collections of unique values
- Support set operations (add, remove)
- Provide type-safe containers
- Enable serialization for backend storage

## Usage

These types are used internally to represent values stored in set attributes. Users typically don't interact with these classes directly but use them implicitly through set operations.

## Parent Module

See `../README.md` for information about Neptune types.
