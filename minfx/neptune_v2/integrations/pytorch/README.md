# PyTorch Integration

This module provides integration with the PyTorch deep learning framework.

## Purpose

The PyTorch integration enables automatic logging of PyTorch training runs, including model architecture, gradients, and training metrics.

## Installation

This integration requires the `neptune-pytorch` package:
```bash
pip install neptune-pytorch
```

## Functionality

The PyTorch integration provides:
- Model architecture logging
- Gradient tracking
- Parameter and metric logging
- Model checkpoint management
- Integration with PyTorch hooks and callbacks

## Usage

The integration is automatically available when the `neptune-pytorch` package is installed. Use PyTorch-specific loggers and utilities through this module.

## Parent Module

See `../README.md` for information about Neptune integrations.
