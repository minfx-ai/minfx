# PyTorch Lightning Integration

This module provides integration with the PyTorch Lightning framework.

## Purpose

The PyTorch Lightning integration enables automatic logging of Lightning training runs, including metrics, hyperparameters, and model checkpoints.

## Installation

This integration requires the `neptune-pytorch-lightning` package:
```bash
pip install neptune-pytorch-lightning
```

## Functionality

The PyTorch Lightning integration provides:
- Automatic logging of training and validation metrics
- Hyperparameter tracking
- Model checkpoint management
- Integration with Lightning callbacks and loggers
- Multi-GPU training support

## Usage

The integration is automatically available when the `neptune-pytorch-lightning` package is installed. Use the Neptune logger with Lightning trainers.

## Parent Module

See `../README.md` for information about Neptune integrations.
