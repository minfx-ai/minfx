# TensorBoard Integration

This module provides integration with TensorBoard visualization toolkit.

## Purpose

The TensorBoard integration enables importing TensorBoard logs into Neptune, allowing unified tracking across different experiment tracking tools.

## Installation

This integration requires the `neptune-tensorboard` package:
```bash
pip install neptune-tensorboard
```

## Functionality

The TensorBoard integration provides:
- TensorBoard log import
- Scalar, histogram, and image data conversion
- Event file parsing
- Unified visualization in Neptune

## Usage

The integration is automatically available when the `neptune-tensorboard` package is installed. Import TensorBoard logs through this module's utilities.

## Parent Module

See `../README.md` for information about Neptune integrations.
