# TensorFlow/Keras Integration

This module provides integration with TensorFlow and Keras deep learning frameworks.

## Purpose

The TensorFlow/Keras integration enables automatic logging of TensorFlow and Keras training runs, including model architecture, metrics, and training progress.

## Installation

This integration requires the `neptune-tensorflow-keras` package:
```bash
pip install neptune-tensorflow-keras
```

## Functionality

The TensorFlow/Keras integration provides:
- Automatic logging of training and validation metrics
- Model architecture visualization
- Callback integration with Keras training
- TensorFlow graph logging
- Model checkpoint management

## Usage

The integration is automatically available when the `neptune-tensorflow-keras` package is installed. Use Keras callbacks through this module to enable Neptune logging.

## Parent Module

See `../README.md` for information about Neptune integrations.
