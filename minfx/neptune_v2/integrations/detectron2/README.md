This module provides integration with Facebook's Detectron2 object detection framework.

## Purpose

The Detectron2 integration enables automatic logging of Detectron2 training runs, including model configurations, metrics, and outputs.

## Installation

This integration requires the `neptune-detectron2` package:
```bash
pip install neptune-detectron2
```

## Functionality

The Detectron2 integration provides:
- Automatic logging of training metrics
- Model configuration tracking
- Checkpoint management
- Visualization of detection results

## Usage

The integration is automatically available when the `neptune-detectron2` package is installed. Use Detectron2-specific callbacks and loggers through this module.
