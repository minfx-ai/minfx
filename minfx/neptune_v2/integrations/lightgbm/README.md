# LightGBM Integration

This module provides integration with the LightGBM gradient boosting framework.

## Purpose

The LightGBM integration enables automatic logging of LightGBM training runs, including metrics, model parameters, and feature importance.

## Installation

This integration requires the `neptune-lightgbm` package:
```bash
pip install neptune-lightgbm
```

## Functionality

The LightGBM integration provides:
- Automatic logging of training metrics
- Model parameter tracking
- Feature importance visualization
- Callback integration with LightGBM training

## Usage

The integration is automatically available when the `neptune-lightgbm` package is installed. Use LightGBM callbacks through this module to enable Neptune logging.

## Parent Module

See `../README.md` for information about Neptune integrations.
